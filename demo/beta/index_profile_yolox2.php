							Jumping is fun! Skydiving is not just falling; it is flying—the closest we have been able to come to free, unencumbered, non-mechanical individual flight. "Bend your knees," he says and I have to obey. From behind, he pulls the strap until the rubber scrapes my skull. I hug my arms against my chest and crank my head back, making the shackles around my thighs tighten further. "Now," he commands, as I try to ignore the gap where the side of the aeroplane should be, "don’t forget to smile for the camera." And with that, we’re gone. Of course, there’s been a build up to my first sky dive. Hundreds of thousands of other people have already done this, including, I’m hoping, my instructor. I use this thought to keep me steady on the morning of the big day. I’ve met people who’ve done parachute-loads of these things, including those for whom it’s simply a matter of getting from A to B: barracks to war zone. Their plight puts my pre-jump jitters into perspective.

											Samson understood his role very well. One cannot be a good follower unless he has clearly identified the leader. While one may be a leader in his own realm, everyone has a boss—including you. Great followers not only accept this fact but embrace it.
