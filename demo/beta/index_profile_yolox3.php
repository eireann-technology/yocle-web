							VOLUNTEER & COMMUNITY SERVICE Stocklerbridge Hospital, Stockler, CA Pediatric Ward Volunteer Fall 20XX - present. Develop and implement activities to entertain patients ages 5-15, including arts and crafts activities and theater workshops, perform administrative work and run errands for pediatric staff, received Volunteer-of-the-Summer award for critical role in developing a theater program for patients I love working as a volunteer in the hospital, entertaining children and teenagers. I learnt so much on how to interact with different types of people and collaborate with other team members to bring the best outcomes. I feel very lucky to have good health, and able to contribute to others who might not be as lucky as I am. The HKU Service Network is a dynamic online platform specifically designed to help HKU students to contribute to global issues through joining and developing sustainable and innovative service projects. The platform enables students and NGOs to interact directly by way of exchanging service ideas and resources. While NGOs can recruit energetic volunteers and fresh ideas in the exchange, students can obtain professional advices and latest field information from front-line workers.

											Samson understood his role very well. One cannot be a good follower unless he has clearly identified the leader. While one may be a leader in his own realm, everyone has a bossâ€”including you. Great followers not only accept this fact but embrace it.
