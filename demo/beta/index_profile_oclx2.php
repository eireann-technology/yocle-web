							The Global Citizenship Summer Institute (GCSI) provides a platform for Social Sciences students to step beyond their academic and physical borders, engaging in intellectual and experiential learning through participating in a four-week intensive study programme in Taiwan and South Korea. GCSI aims to enhance Social Sciences students\' awareness of the importance of Asia in the globalizing world. Students will spend first two weeks in Taiwan and following two weeks in South Korea attending academic lectures relating to three focus areas: social, cultural and political developments in Taiwan and South Korea. Students will critically examine these focus areas through a comparative lens as well as analyzing their regional and global implications. Field visits to civil society organizations and political and cultural parties will be organized to provide students with a more holistic understanding of Taiwanese and South Korean societies. By the end of these four weeks, students will gain a unique perspective on Asia through interacting with academics, students, community leaders and people in the selected Asian societies.

											Samson understood his role very well. One cannot be a good follower unless he has clearly identified the leader. While one may be a leader in his own realm, everyone has a bossâ€”including you. Great followers not only accept this fact but embrace it.
