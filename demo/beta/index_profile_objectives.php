				The study of Social Science is appealing to me because of the diversity of topics they cover and their relevance to our world today. In an increasingly globalised world, it is important to have a deep understanding of the economic and political institutions that govern, and the cultural backgrounds and values of its citizens.<br/><br/>
				I like travelling and it has broadened my mind to the issues facing our world, and inspired me to investigate further into our origins and the workings of society. After my studies, I hope to work in social welfare and make a meaningful contribution to improving the lives of others and society. I have always enjoyed and felt confident in academia and in experiencing the world outside of the classroom I have been able to confirm my aspirations in life, making me a very motivated, enthusiastic and committed student.
