							In May 2016, I was involved in an experiential learning project with Doctors without Borders. I was responsible to coordinate the Hong Kong sector, including collecting resources and materials to the east of China. I felt so grateful to love this opportunity to meet, learn and develop myself. Experiential learning is the process of learning through experience, and is more specifically defined as "learning through reflection on doing". Hands-on learning is a form of experiential learning but does not necessarily involve students reflecting on their product. Experiential learning is distinct from rote or didactic learning, in which the learner plays a comparatively passive role. It is related to but not synonymous with other forms of active learning such as action learning, adventure learning, free choice learning, cooperative learning, and service learning.

											Samson understood his role very well. One cannot be a good follower unless he has clearly identified the leader. While one may be a leader in his own realm, everyone has a bossâ€”including you. Great followers not only accept this fact but embrace it.
