							Whether it be internationally or locally, the HKRC is without fail always willing to lend a helping hand and show support no matter what the situation. I can surely tell you that this organization has been making a difference and will continue to make a difference to the world for years to come.

Red Cross is the ideal service organization for a HKU student; it requires commitment and attendance, while meetings are efficient and very organized. Not only that, but it is possible to find a service activity for so many different interests, both on and off campus. Walking into a meeting, you will find a diverse group of students, but we all have one thing in common: we love to serve, and we are all genuinely nice people!
