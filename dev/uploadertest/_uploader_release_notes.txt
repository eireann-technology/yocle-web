	- a.uploader.js
		> considered wrong mime type (client and server)
		> considered multiple loading
		> considered no media yet
		
	- server cannot determine file type
		> added resumableFileCat and passed from client
		
	- file.pbar not created yet
		> it should not happen because the pbar is created before upload()?
		> fixed by considering added again

					 query: { name: "Tom", state: "active", rating: { $gt: 10 } },
					 sort: { rating: 1 },
					 update: { $inc: { score: 1 } }
				 }
			)
			- The query finds a document in the people collection where the name field has the value Tom, the state field has the value active and the rating field has a value greater than 10.
			- The sort orders the results of the query in ascending order. If multiple documents meet the query condition, the command will select for modification the first document as ordered by this sort.
			- The update increments the value of the score field by 1.
