New Items
18. Registration – I will think of an alternative approach.
- Just a suggestion as discussed, we may import the email address before the first day of the activities. Then they may sign in themselves. This may be your original idea. Right? You may suggest another one as well.

19. At the moment only coordinator can edit so hard to add photos and videos during the activities – all assessors/coordinators/participants are allowed to upload photos/videos (1 day)
- Okay.

20. Poster add two retitled Media Files(Poster/Video/Audio/Pdf) (5 days)
- Okay.

21. It would be good if the comments can be seen while scrolling the photos (2 days)
- That would do.

22. If students accidentally submitted want to resubmit, possible before the deadline? [done]
- Request to resubmit will would solve this issue. i.e. item 10

23. Too complicated view for marking, statistics and assessment. (8 days?)
- I have thought a maybe simpler approach. i.e. the activities will only show on the activity page once instead of three times. after clicking the activity row, it will have a three tabs for the three roles: coordinator, assessors and participant. We can even show a filter and number of users submitted/marked on the top. What would you think? We would discuss more about this when you come back. perhaps with some screenshots first.

24. Add status (submitted, marked, saved, request to resubmit) in Markings. (5 days)
- That would do and make marking and statistics easier. It involves a bit change in the database but it is possible.

25. Needs a total mark for that activity for the generic skills as overview. (4 days) [done]
- Yes. Better show how the calculation is done for the skills as well.

27. Needs settings for password, email addresses and also birthday (can hide Year) (5 days) [done]

28. Don't know who has submitted their assignments, overall submission 
- Yes. Item 23 and 24 would do this.

- Yes. Item 23 would do this.

30. Print profile, assessment %, feedback and activity (5 days)
