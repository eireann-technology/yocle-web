	- user interface design (view and deletion)

	- middleware

10. Too complicated view for marking, statistics and assessment. (8 days?)
	- I have thought a maybe simpler approach. i.e. the activities will only show on the activity page once instead of three times. after clicking the activity row, it will have a three tabs for the three roles: coordinator, assessors and participant. We can even show a filter and number of users submitted/marked on the top. What would you think? We would discuss more about this when you come back. perhaps with some screenshots first.

11. Add status (submitted, marked, saved, request to resubmit) in Markings. (5 days)
	- That would do and make marking and statistics easier. It involves a bit change in the database but it is possible.

12. Don't know who has submitted their assignments, overall submission 
	- Yes. Item 23 and 24 would do this.

13. Marking % does not make sense, best to show how many out of many have been marked and by whom 
	- Yes. Item 23 would do this.

14. Messages cannot see old messages Cannot see old messages try SHK
	- Need some investigations and observation here.

15. View activity back button does not go back to previous (forget this at the moment)
	- Will observe.

16. Add import users function for participants and assessors. just put in emails in the text file.

17. for marking, add a feature to allow upload additional information (e.g. scanned paperwork) 

18. blog assessment

19. journal assessment

20. Registration – I will think of an alternative approach.
	- Just a suggestion as discussed, we may import the email address before the first day of the activities. Then they may sign in themselves. This may be your original idea. Right? You may suggest another one as well.

21. At the moment only coordinator can edit so hard to add photos and videos during the activities – all assessors/coordinators/participants are allowed to upload photos/videos (1 day)
	- Okay.

22. Poster add two retitled Media Files(Poster/Video/Audio/Pdf) (5 days)
	- Okay.

23. It would be good if the comments can be seen while scrolling the photos (2 days)
	- That would do.
